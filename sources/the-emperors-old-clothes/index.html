<p>The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay.</p>
</blockquote>

	    
		<blockquote>
<p>If our basic tool, the language in which we design and code our programs, is also complicated, the language itself becomes part of the problem rather than part of its solution.</p>
</blockquote>

	    
		<blockquote>
<p>A feature which is omitted can always be added later, when its design and its implications are well understood. A feature which is included before it is fully understood can never be removed later.</p>
</blockquote>

	    
		<blockquote>
<p>I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are <em>obviously</em> no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no <em>obvious deficiencies</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

	    
		<blockquote>
<p>we recognized that a subset could be an improvement on the original.</p>
</blockquote>

	    
		<blockquote>
<p>First, we certainly want programs to be read by <em>people</em> and people prefer to read things once in a single pass.</p>
</blockquote>

	    
		<blockquote>
<p>In any respectable branch of engineering, failure to observe such elementary precautions would have long been against the law.</p>
